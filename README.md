# Overseer  
A configurable logging bot for Discord to log all known events to set channels per server.  
What happens in your server stays in your server, we only store channel and guild ID's for configuration.  

### Setup steps for development  
- Register a new bot on the Discord Developer Portal if you haven't got one already.  
- Clone the repo and open it in VSCode or your own workspace of choice (For this example I'm using VSCode)  
- Run ``yarn install`` in the built-in terminal and wait for it to finish.  
- Rename the template ``example.env`` file to just ``.env`` and configure it as required.  
- To finally launch the bot in development use ``yarn start`` in the same terminal as earlier.
